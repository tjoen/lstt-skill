## Trivia skill with local stt - WIP
This skill starts a game of general trivia with local speech-to-text.

## Description 
At the moment, the skill will ask you 3 "general knowledge" questions. You can answer by choosing 1,2,3 or 4.
Yes, No, Stop, Repeat and Start should also work.

This testskill uses mycrofts pocketsphinx STT with a small dict.

It uses a localstt.dic (dictionairy) and localstt.lm (language model) in the res folder.

## Current state
Working features:
- Version seems to work, very messy
- great improvement on speech results.

## Known issues:
It's a test skill, so work in progress

## Examples 
* "Hey Mycroft, start local speech"
* "Hey Mycroft, local speech test"
